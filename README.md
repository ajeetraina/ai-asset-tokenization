## 💬 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Complete Tokenization Workflow

**User Query:**
```
I want to tokenize a commercial property worth SAR 50 million on King Fahd Road, Riyadh. 
The property generates SAR 4 million annual rental income. 
I need a Shariah-compliant structure.
```

**Agent Workflow:**
```
1. Master Coordinator → Analyzes request
2. Due Diligence Agent → Verifies property ownership
3. Compliance Agent → Checks SAMA/CMA requirements
4. Shariah Agent → Designs Islamic finance structure
5. Valuation Agent → Confirms SAR 50M valuation
6. Deal Structure Agent → Creates SPV + token economics
7. Smart Contract Agent → Generates ERC-1400 contract
8. Audit Agent → Security review
9. Contract Agent → Generates PPM, agreements
10. Investor Onboarding Agent → Ready to onboard investors
```

**Expected Output:**
- Compliance report (2 minutes)
- Smart contract code (5 minutes)
- Legal documents (10 minutes)
- Full tokenization package (20 minutes total)

### Example 2: Compliance Check Only

**User Query:**
```
Check if this token purchase agreement is SAMA and CMA compliant.
[Upload document]
```

**Agent Workflow:**
```
1. Master Coordinator → Routes to compliance
2. Document Agent → Extracts key clauses
3. Compliance Agent → Runs SAMA/CMA checks
4. Regulatory Monitor Agent → Checks latest rules
```

**Output:**
- Compliance score: 85%
- Issues identified: 3
- Recommendations: 5
- Estimated fix time: 2 weeks

### Example 3: Shariah Compliance Review

**User Query:**
```
Is this profit-sharing structure Shariah compliant?
Annual returns: 8% fixed
Payment: Quarterly
Asset: Commercial real estate
```

**Agent Workflow:**
```
1. Master Coordinator → Routes to Shariah
2. Shariah Agent → Analyzes structure
3. Deal Structure Agent → Suggests alternatives
```

**Output:**
```
❌ NOT SHARIAH COMPLIANT

Issue: Fixed returns constitute riba (interest)

Recommended Alternative:
✅ Profit-Sharing (Mudarabah) Structure:
- Actual rental income distributed quarterly
- Variable returns based on performance
- Profits shared: 80% investors, 20% manager
- Losses borne by investors only

Shariah Certificate: Available after restructuring
```

### Example 4: Investor Onboarding

**User Query:**
```
I want to invest SAR 100,000 in the Riyadh property token. 
I'm a Saudi national with investment experience.
```

**Agent Workflow:**
```
1. Investor Onboarding Agent → Welcomes investor
2. KYC Agent → Verifies identity (National ID, bank statement)
3. Compliance Agent → Checks accreditation status
4. Investor Onboarding Agent → Processes subscription
5. Smart Contract Agent → Mints 100 tokens to wallet
```

**Timeline:**
- KYC verification: 1-2 days
- Documentation: 1 day
- Payment processing: 1 day
- Token issuance: Same day after payment
- **Total: 3-4 days**
