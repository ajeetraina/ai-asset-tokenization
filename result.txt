## Run 1: Single Agent

File: cagent-single.yaml

```
Generate an ERC-1400 security token contract for Riyadh Property Token.

Symbol: RPT
Supply: 50,000
Features:
- Transfer restrictions
- Whitelist for KYC investors
- Dividend distribution
- Pausable

Provide the Solidity code.
```

## Result 1:


Look at what it generated:

âœ… transfer() function with whitelist restrictions
âœ… distributeDividends() function for profit distribution
âœ… pause() function for emergency control
âœ… Proper access control checks

This is exactly what you need for a security token!

## Run 2:

```
Can you complete the full contract? I need:
1. The contract header with imports
2. Constructor to initialize the token
3. Whitelist management functions
4. Events for all actions

Show me the complete ERC-1400 contract.
```

### 1. Shariah Compliance Check
```
Is this token structure Shariah compliant?

Features:
- Quarterly dividend distribution from rental income
- Variable returns based on actual profits

### 3. Token Economics
```
Design token economics for:

Property Value: SAR 50M
Annual Rental Income: SAR 4M
Total Tokens: 50,000

```

### 4. Legal Structure

```
What legal entity structure should I use for tokenizing real estate in Saudi Arabia?

Should I use:

Explain the pros and cons of each.
