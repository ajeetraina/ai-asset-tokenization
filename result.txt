## Run 1: Single Agent

File: cagent-single.yaml

```
Generate an ERC-1400 security token contract for Riyadh Property Token.

Symbol: RPT
Supply: 50,000
Features:
- Transfer restrictions
- Whitelist for KYC investors
- Dividend distribution
- Pausable

Provide the Solidity code.
```

## Result 1:


Look at what it generated:

âœ… transfer() function with whitelist restrictions
âœ… distributeDividends() function for profit distribution
âœ… pause() function for emergency control
âœ… Proper access control checks

This is exactly what you need for a security token!

## Run 2:

```
Can you complete the full contract? I need:
1. The contract header with imports
2. Constructor to initialize the token
3. Whitelist management functions
4. Events for all actions

Show me the complete ERC-1400 contract.
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Other Great Questions to Try

### 1. Shariah Compliance Check
```
Is this token structure Shariah compliant?

Features:
- Quarterly dividend distribution from rental income
- Variable returns based on actual profits
- No fixed interest rates
- Real estate backing

Should I use Mudarabah or Musharakah structure?
```

### 2. Compliance Requirements
```
What are the key SAMA and CMA requirements for launching this token in Saudi Arabia?

Token: RPT (Riyadh Property Token)
Type: Security token (ERC-1400)
Investors: Saudi retail and institutional
Value: SAR 50M
```

### 3. Token Economics
```
Design token economics for:

Property Value: SAR 50M
Annual Rental Income: SAR 4M
Total Tokens: 50,000
Target Investors: 200-500 people

Calculate:
- Price per token
- Expected annual return
- Minimum investment
- Quarterly distribution amount
```

### 4. Legal Structure

```
What legal entity structure should I use for tokenizing real estate in Saudi Arabia?

Should I use:
- SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle)
- Trust structure
- Direct ownership

Explain the pros and cons of each.
```
Result 2:

ðŸŽ‰ EXCELLENT! The contract is generating beautifully!Look at the quality code you're getting:
âœ… mint() function - With proper validations
âœ… burn() function - Token burning capability
âœ… Events - TransferRestrictions, WhitelistForKycInvestors, DividendDistribution
âœ… Token counter - Increment/decrement tracking
âœ… Error handling - Clear validation messages
âœ… Array management - Proper balance tracking


## Run 3: Get the complete contract

```
Show me the complete contract from the beginning including:
1. SPDX license and pragma
2. Import statements (OpenZeppelin)
3. Contract declaration
4. State variables
5. Constructor
6. All functions we discussed

Make it ready to compile.
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Next?

### Option 1: Save and Use This Code
```
Can you provide the complete contract in a single code block that I can save as RiyadhPropertyToken.sol?
```

### Option 2: Add More Features
```
Add these additional features to the contract:
1. Emergency withdrawal function
2. Multi-signature approval for critical operations
3. Time-locked transfers
4. Voting mechanism for token holders
```

### Option 3: Test Shariah Compliance
```
Review this contract for Shariah compliance:
- Does the dividend distribution avoid riba?
- Is the profit-sharing mechanism compliant?
- What changes are needed for full Islamic finance compliance?
```

### Option 4: Get Deployment Instructions
```
How do I deploy this contract to:
1. Local testnet (Hardhat/Foundry)
2. Polygon Mumbai testnet
3. Ethereum mainnet

Provide deployment script and verification steps.
```
